<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:white;">Hi. Welcome to my website, this website is still a work in progress for me as I'm still learning new things with HTML, so if this site seems a little bare-bones, that's probably why. There are a couple links and extra pages you can check out while you're on here, and I'll be working on this sometimes to add new things. Thanks for visiting!</p>
<p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:white;">Here you can check out some pages I've added to make this place a little cozier. :)</p>
